# MAUSAM_PATRA
A proposed Idea for Onspot Hackathon By NIT DURGAPUR
<H1>PROBLEM STATEMENT</H1>
<p>Agriculture is an important part of our economy with a huge portion of population following this as their career.​
Yet, the department suffers a lot of loss on a yearly basis.
Most of the losses are due to the sudden changes in weather about which farmers do not have any information.​
News on crops getting destroyed due to rainfall or storms have become a daily thing for us.</p>
<h2>Solution</h2>
<p>A software that collects the weather data and​
 displays it accordingly​
on panchayat offices or specially installed boards in villages, that can be viewed by everyone.​

Any sort of sudden change in weather,​
good or bad,​
is communicated to everyone by alarms installed in between every 2-3 pillars.​

Farmers can take steps accordingly​
and save their crops.​</p>
<h3>Data Required</h3>
<p>Temperature​
Tracking changes in temperature over time, gives outlook for crop conditions and inputs for further analytics on​
conditions determining weather changes.​
​

Wind​
Wind direction and speed​
can warn farmers of​
an upcoming storm.​
​

Air Pressure​
This is one of the​
most important measurements​
for predicting weather changes.​
​

Humidity​
This metric is critical,​
 especially when preparing for rain​
and using water smartly.​</p>

<H1>How to Run software</h1>
<p>Just run MAUSAM_PATERA.exe file and it will fetch the weather information of the next day of the village.<br>
  There is an alarm, if there is going to rain after 24hr alarm will automatically start.<br>
  <b>CURRENTLY ALARM IS SET FOR CLEAR WEATHER AND CITY AS SITAPUR.</b>
